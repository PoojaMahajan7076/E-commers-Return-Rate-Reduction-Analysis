ðŸ“Š E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing product return behavior in an e-commerce setting. The goal is to identify why customers return products and how return rates vary across categories, geographies, and marketing channels. Insights from the analysis help reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Analyze return % per product category and supplier.

Identify high-risk products/customers for returns.

Predict probability of return using machine learning.

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights.

ðŸ›  Tools Used

SQL â†’ Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

Python â†’ Logistic regression model to predict returns.

Power BI â†’ Dashboard creation for interactive reporting.

ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
